##Broadcast Receiver Example

In this example code we investigate what a broadcast receiver app is and how to implement on on the android platform.

A broadcast receiver is an android component or piece of application that responds to a system wide announcement. 
This announcement could typically be a call or sms being received by the phone.

###Create an android project
We create an android project by file > new > other > Android > Android Application Project.
Give the project the relevant information and create a main activity. Even for a broadcast receiver this is 
needed.

Run the application as an android application to make sure the application is copied to the phone and runs on
the phone.
